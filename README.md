# My Elements

## What is it?
A way for me to add an element a day (ideally) as I learn them. I am also adding a little atomic number quiz so I can mix them up and not always go in order.
I am doing a push up a day and counting by elements; therefore, this is no rush. 

## Where I am with it
It started out in an ES6 playground, and has been copied and moved over to be it's own. I play and experiment, then move. The ES6 version is vanilla JavaScript to keep me up on my 'nilla. This one will be in jQuery, to keep my Q en pointe. 

## What are my plans?
* Style with Flexbox
    - Mobile at iPhone 6+: where I'll quiz myself
    - Laptop: where I read about the element
* Make the mobile version use a counter so I can use it while doing my pushups as a sort of metronome ... The nature of this may keep me at Chlorine.
